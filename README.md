## About
This mod modifies bow behaviour to require some skill, increasing aim randomness the longer the bow is held fully charged. As of now, there's no visual indicator for this but it may be added.

## Downloads
Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amot-dev/skilled-marksman-mod/releases) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/skilled-marksman-mod).
Will soon be available on Curseforge (maybe).

## Installation
- Install Fabric for the desired Minecraft version

- Copy the skilled-marksman jar file into `.minecraft/mods`

## Backport Requests
If you would like a new feature to be backported to an older version, please submit an issue and I will address it if possible.
